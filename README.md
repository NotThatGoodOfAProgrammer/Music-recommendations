# Music recommendations

Built on Spotify API

## Still in build
<!-- yeah for now I copied my previous README file and modified it to match this project -->

To do:
1. Tablet and PC design
2. Cleaning code
3. Finishing this README file
4. Deploying App on GitHub Pages
5. *Maybe* Changing window.alert() to  custom notification box
6. *Maybe* Include guide on how to use the app either on App itself or in README

In random order
