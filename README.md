# Music recommendations

Built on Spotify API

## Still in build

To do:
1. Cleaning code
2. Finishing this README file
3. *Maybe* Changing window.alert() to  custom notification box
4. *Maybe* Include guide on how to use the app either on App itself or in README

In random order

## Description:
Main purpose of this project was to learn React, fetching from APIs and how to use Git and GitHub.
Developed with Mobile First Design. Idea sparked out while reading APIs features
and recalling frustration from mismatched Spotify recommendations.<br>
**Note:** "Tablet and desktop design" branch is left on purpose.

## The most crucial techniques that I have improved at/learned are:
1. React components and states
2. Fetching
3. Data processing
4. Git commands and terminal usage in general
5. CSS pseudo-classes
