## Description:

Main purpose of this project was to learn React, fetching from APIs and how to use Git and GitHub.
Developed with Mobile First Design. Idea sparked out while reading APIs features
and recalling frustration from mismatched Spotify recommendations.<br>
**Note:** "Tablet and desktop design" branch is left on purpose.

## The most crucial techniques that I have improved at/learned are:

1. React components and states
2. Fetching
3. Data processing
4. Git commands and terminal usage in general
5. CSS pseudo-classes
6. Writing README.md files

## How to use guide:

1. Click on "Get token" and login with Spotify account
2. Choose what type you are looking for in filters
3. *Optional* Select date release and/or genres in filters
4. Type in name of what you are looking for
5. Click on submit button or press enter in search bar
6. Browse through results and find the one you are looking for
7. Click the plus button on selected result
8. Add more results if you wish to*
9. Press button in top right corner
10. *Optional* Choose genres*
11. Click on "See results" and enjoy **Music recommendations**

\* *only up to 5 results and genres combined can be choosen at once*

## Possible issues
